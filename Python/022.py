# Project Euler | Problem 22 | Jacob Waters
# What is the total of all the name scores in the file?
# For example, when the list is sorted into alphabetical order, COLIN, 
# which is worth 3 + 15 + 12 + 9 + 14 = 53, is the 938th name in the list.
# So, COLIN would obtain a score of 938 Ã— 53 = 49714.
# 871198282
