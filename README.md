# EulerProject

These are my solutions to problems found on [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/). I mainly write my solutions in Python because I find it a fun language that allows for some creative "one-liners", and it is so simple to achieve straightforward things. I am always looking to refactor my solutions for more elegant syntax, so the code here is changing as I learn.
